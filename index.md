## 📖 Overview
This repository demonstrates how to use the JDX ORM framework. With it, you can easily generate model class definitions and a declarative object-relational mapping (ORM) specification from an existing relational database schema. This tool simplifies database interaction, making it easier for users to manage data without deep programming knowledge.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started, follow these steps:

1. Ensure your computer meets the following requirements:
   - Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
   - Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 8 or higher
   - At least 512 MB of RAM

2. Download the application from the Releases page using the link above.

3. Unzip the downloaded file to your desired location. 

4. Navigate to the folder where you unzipped the application.

## 📤 Usage Instructions
Now that you have downloaded and unzipped the application, you can run it by following these steps:

1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt for Windows, Terminal for macOS/Linux).
2. Change to the directory where you unzipped the application. You can do this with the `cd` command. For example:  
   ```
   cd path/to/unzipped/folder
   ```
3. Start the application with the following command:  
   ```
   java -jar JDX_ReverseEngineeringJSONExample.jar
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to reverse-engineer your database schema. You'll need access to your database connection details.
